A group of five matriculants were ecstatic to receive their matric results together on Friday, 20 January, as a milestone in their friendship. The girls became a best-friend group of five when they entered high school at Witteklip Secondary School in 2018 and while three of them already made up important parts of each other’s lives since primary school, they said that going through the ups and downs of high school life together was something they will always cherish. “We have been with each other through the highs and lows, the happiness and the sorrows and, most especially, the stress that we went through just to pass this year. We are very grateful to have each other as our support systems and we are all excited for each other since we all passed,” said 17-year-old Kimera Naidoo. The girls even chose the same course subjects of Business Studies, Life Sciences and History with three of them opting for Maths Literacy and two for Mathematics. “We had a lot of fun together over the years and we thoroughly enjoyed our academic careers to the fullest. However, when it was time to settle down and put in that hard work, we really tried our best and our efforts really did pay off as none of us got left behind. We began this journey together and we have ended it together too,” said 17-year-old Rebekah Pillay and 18-year-old Judaea Govindsamy. The girls all agreed upon the best advice for this year’s batch of matriculants and said: “No relationships at all! There’s no need for such a distraction in one of the most important years of your life and if you are lucky enough to have a girl squad like us, remember it’s sisters before misters, always!” With career options ranging from the South African Police Service, management and nursing, the girls are excited for what the future holds for them as they begin a new chapter post-high school. Deborah Govender (17) and Ameena Mohamed (18) said: “We would also like to wish the Class of 2023 all the very best for their matric year.”
