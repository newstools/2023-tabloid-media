The Kloof and Highway SPCA celebrated World Spay Day by hosting an outreach programme where 27 furry friends were sterilised at their clinic on Tuesday, 28 February. World Spay Day is celebrated annually on the fourth Tuesday of February, or February 28 this year. The failure to spay and neuter dogs and cats is responsible for millions of unwanted animals living on the streets without shelter or food or being euthanized in shelters around the world. Kloof and Highway SPCA inspector and marketing manager, Brigitte Ferguson said the outreach was aimed at preventing cases of litter of unwanted puppies. “The outreach was a resounding success. It gave us and the dogs the chance to live without the burden of endless litters, sexually transmitted diseases and endless cruelty. All animals went home with a bag of food and the prospect of a brighter and healthier future. Anyone can choose to be part of this initiative by donating towards making a difference,” she said. Ferguson thanked non-profit organisation, K9 for their support and involvement in the outreach initiative. “We have all made a difference. We are still in need of blankets for our Outreach Clinic as well as financial support,” said Ferguson.
