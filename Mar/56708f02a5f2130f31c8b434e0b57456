The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has said that the party remains committed to holding its members, leaders and public representatives to the highest level of discipline during a National Executive Committee meeting on Monday, 6 March, in which Councillor Abbas Warasally of Alfred Duma Local Municipality was recalled as a councillor, with his resignation being effective immediately. The Speaker of Alfred Duma Municipality will step in and will be handling the issues of the ward for Ward 20 in the interim. In a press release issued on Monday afternoon, 6 March, the IFP further stated that Councillor Mncedisi Maphisa, the Mayor of AbaQulusi Local Municipality, has been recalled as mayor and that a new mayor will be announced in due course. Both Warasally and Maphisa have been linked to explicit voice recordings. The IFP reiterated its firm position in support of women’s rights, condemning any abuse of office and authority that takes advantage of women. Democratic Alliance (DA) KZN Leader, Francois Rodgers (MPL), said that he welcomes the action by the IFP against the AbaQulusi Mayor and Alfred Duma Local Municipality Councillor. “Effective and clean governance can only be achieved through consequence and accountability. This bodes well for the future relationship between the IFP and the DA as we move towards the 2024 elections,” said Rodgers.
