South Coast snake catcher, Sarel Van der Merwe, has been dicing between green mamba and black mamba rescues all the way from Port Shepstone to Hibberdene with the feared reptiles seeking refuge in some hard-to-reach spots. Recently, Van der Merwe and his assistant, Emma-Jane Cox, responded to a call out in Melville, Port Shepstone. “Emma and I started the day in Melville, Port Shepstone for a green mamba in the roof. It was like a sauna in there and I had to watch my step not to fall through the ceiling. I heard someone behind me and there was Emma on her stomach, taking photos and trying to help me.”  The second call out was to Boboyi for a black mamba. “I looked all over the house and when I entered the kitchen, I heard a hissing sound. That’s the sound they make when threatened, angry or annoyed. I thankfully managed to remove him safely,” said Van der Merwe. Following a two-hour drive after the Boboyi rescue, Van der Merwe found himself in Hlanzeni, Umzumbe, for another black mamba in a house. “It wasn’t easy to find the place as most times there is no cellphone reception. Much appreciation to SAPS and locals for their help on the road. The snake was hiding in the ceiling of the bedroom.” In Hibberdene, a black mamba concealed itself inside a house. “After moving a lot of items, I spotted him behind a generator,” said Van der Merwe.
