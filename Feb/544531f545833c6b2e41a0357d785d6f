Heavy rains once again battered Newcastle and surrounding areas last night, 13 February, causing flooding and widespread damage to homes and businesses. The rain caused the banks of the Ncandu and Jordan rivers to burst, leaving roads and homes flooded. The Newcastle community banded together to assist those in need with sand bags, blankets, food and other essential services. Rescue missions were also underway to evacuate people from their homes. Some of the main areas affected were wards 3, 7, 11, 17, 21 and 25 as well as many businesses along Kirkland Street and the taxi rank. Mayor of Newcastle, Xolani Dube, said that emergency services and the Municipality Disaster Management Team are on the ground attending to the affected areas. “Assessments are underway to determine the total number of households and businesses affected. We urge residents to stay calm, keep safe and stay away from flooded areas,” said Mayor Dube. Some of the residents in Ward 3 voiced concern over the fact that Mayor Dube had not visited the ward. “Last night the Deputy Mayor and the Municipal Manager came out to a few homes. However, it is sad that our ward always seems to be left out of the Mayor’s oversights. Residents need help and we need to know that our municipal officials are standing with us during this disaster. People are in need of food, detergents, brooms and mops in order to clean up the damage,” said an irate resident. Ward 3 Councillor, Connie Hariram, expressed her thanks to those who assisted. “I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to the community of Newcastle for your support and care to the flood victims. Your donations of hot meals, marquees, mattresses, blankets and groceries is greatly appreciated,” said Hariram. For emergency services the community is advised to contact Newcastle Municipality on the following alternative number: 079-542-8228.
