The legacy of St Valentine means that for the month of February, people think of their hearts, most importantly how to keep it healthy, beating and free from disease.  St John, an international charity organisation which provides first aid, healthcare and support services in 40 countries around the world is offering Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Cardio (CPR) workshops to residents for month of love. Regional training manager, East Coast at St John, Shivani Gopi said they want to teach South Africans how to keep their hearts beating during February, the month of love.  “CPR is an emergency life-saving procedure performed when the heart stops beating. It increases the chances of survival after a person’s breathing or heart stops. It is easy to learn and can save a person’s life. Once learned correctly, even children can perform successful CPR on adults and adults on children. Many countries formally acknowledge February as Heart Health Awareness Month which provides a useful focus to remind us to take care of our heart; to promote education about heart health, and it raises awareness about heart disease as it is one of the biggest causes of death globally,” she said.  In Durban, courses are being held at St John offices located on KE Masinga Road. For more information contact, 031-305-6588.
