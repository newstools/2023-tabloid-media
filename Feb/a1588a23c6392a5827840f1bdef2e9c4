The Durban Regional Court has sentenced a Westcliff-based attorney to five years’ imprisonment, of which two years are wholly suspended for a period of five years, following his conviction on fraud. Shameer Goolabjith (41) will serve an effective three years’ imprisonment. Natasha Ramkissoon-Kara, spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority, said that in July 2015, Goolabjith falsified a claim purportedly on behalf of a complainant, suing the Minister of Police. “He did this without any instruction or request from the complainant. The potential prejudice of the claim is estimated at R100 000,” she said. In court, Senior Public Prosecutor, Nkululeko Frank Msiya, led the testimonies of the complainant, his wife and the evidence following an effective search warrant. “After sentencing, Goolabjith – represented by his attorney – made an application for leave to appeal his sentence and conviction. This was turned down by the court. He then advised the court that they want to petition a judge on this decision. The case was therefore adjourned for a bail application pending the petition process. Goolabjith is in custody in the interim,” said Ramkissoon-Kara.
